Dungeon-Game-
=============

A relatively simple dungeon game written in python - part of my python learning experience

**Objective**


Escape through the magic door, while simultaneously avoiding the dreaded monster. You can move left, up, down, or right. The door is at a randomized location, as well as the monster.

To run: 

```sh
$ python dungeon_game.py
```
